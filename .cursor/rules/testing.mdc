# Testing

## Test Format

* Never use **table-driven tests**
* Always write **one testing function per tested function**
* Named with the pattern `Test{NameOfFunction}`
* Each test function must:
  * Start with a `t.Parallel()` call at the root of the test.
  * Define all test cases as **subtests** using `t.Run()`.
  * Each subtest must also call `t.Parallel()` inside it.
